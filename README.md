## Overview

**Pathik** is a **Smart City Navigation and Safety Assistance System** designed to make urban navigation safer and more reliable — especially for **women and vulnerable citizens**.  
This repository contains the **User Interface (UI)** of the Pathik platform.

Our goal is to combine **real-time navigation**, **safety alerts**, and **community-driven support** into a single, intuitive experience that empowers users to move confidently through the city.

### This is a prototype UI for our Idea.
